# Bloggerless

Bloggerless is going to be a really awesome serverless blog framework. It will allow you to author posts and publish 
them via AWS S3. Both the website and your post data are hosted as static files. This makes it both really fast to 
load and really cheap to host.

I'm building it because I want to be able to host blogs for my wife and I where we have full controll over both the code 
and styling and can customize it however we want, but don't have to mess with servers and databases etc., and also don't 
have to pay more than a few cents a month for them.

I'm inspired by the [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) blogging platform, the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) 
project, and the [Redux Real World](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world) example project.

If you have found this open source codebase useful in any way, or if you are interested in contributing, feel free to reach out to me.

## Development info

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
